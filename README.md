## Sematic-Analysis

This repository presents a series of in-depth explorations into cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, focusing on understanding vector semantics via the Skip-Gram model, detecting sarcasm in textual data, and conducting semantic analysis to derive meaningful insights from text.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three primary Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a specific aspect of NLP. Through these notebooks, we demonstrate the application of various machine learning models and NLP techniques to solve complex problems in the realm of text analysis.

### Notebooks Description

#### 1. Vector-Semantic-SkipGram.ipynb

- **Objective**: Explore vector semantics using the Skip-Gram model to generate word embeddings, facilitating a deeper understanding of word relationships and similarities.
- **Methodology**: We preprocess the text data to prepare it for model training, utilize the Skip-Gram model from the Gensim library to create word embeddings, and then visualize these embeddings to examine the semantic relationships between words.
- **Results**: The model successfully captures semantic similarities and analogies between words, demonstrating the effectiveness of word embeddings in understanding text.
- **Libraries Used**: Gensim, Matplotlib, NumPy.

#### 2. Sarcasem-Detection.ipynb

- **Objective**: Develop a model capable of identifying sarcasm in textual data, a critical step for accurate sentiment analysis and natural language understanding.
- **Methodology**: This notebook details the process of collecting a labeled dataset, extracting features relevant to sarcasm detection, training a classification model, and evaluating its performance.
- **Results**: The trained model shows promising results in sarcasm detection, highlighting the nuances and challenges of interpreting textual data.
- **Libraries Used**: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

#### 3. Semantic-Analysis.ipynb

- **Objective**: Perform semantic analysis to extract deep meaning from text, enabling applications such as sentiment analysis, topic discovery, and text summarization.
- **Methodology**: We apply various semantic analysis techniques, including Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and sentiment analysis models, to process and interpret large volumes of text.
- **Results**: Our analysis reveals underlying themes, sentiments, and insights within the text data, showcasing the power of semantic analysis in NLP.
- **Libraries Used**: NLTK, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas.
